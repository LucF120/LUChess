# LUChess
My name is Luc Ferrara, and I am a Computer Science student at Northeastern University. On the side, I am a 2000+ rated chess player on both Chess.com and lichess.org (my username is Luc120 on both sites). I love chess, so I have decided to try to create a chess application of my own as a fun side challenge.

My goals are to accomplish the following steps (order may be subject to change as I go): 
<ol>
	<li>Create and define a class hierarchy for all the components of the game of chess (the board, the pieces, teams, etc)</li>
	<li>Allow the user to play a game of chess in the console (playing as both teams)</li> 
	<li>Allow the user to play a game of chess in the console against the computer (computer making random moves)</li>
	<li>Allow the user to play a game of chess in the console against a smart computer (need to integrate an open-source chess engine)</li>
	<li>Create a GUI to allow the user to play a game of chess against the smart computer, while seeing the board and being able to interact with it</li> 
	<li>Integrate this application with my website to allow users to be able to play against the computer from lucferrara.com/chess</li>
	<li>Far in the future: make lucferrara.com/chess an online experience!</li>
	
</ol>
