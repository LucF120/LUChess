# LUChess
My name is Luc Ferrara, and I am a Computer Science student at Northeastern University. On the side, I am a 2000+ rated chess player on both chess.com and lichess.org (my username is Luc120 on both sites). I love chess, so I have decided to try to create a chess application of my own as a fun side challenge.

My goals are to accomplish the following steps (the order may be subject to change): 
<ol>
	<li>Create and define a class hierarchy for all the components of the game of chess (the board, the pieces, teams, etc), and create functions for the different actions in the game (winning, losing, moving pieces, capturing pieces, check, checkmate, stalemate, etc)</li> 
	<li>Allow the user to play a game of chess in the console (playing as both teams)</li> 
	<li>Allow the user to play a game of chess in the console against the computer (computer making random moves)</li>
	<li>Allow the user to play a game of chess in the console against a smart computer (need to integrate an open-source chess engine)</li>
	<li>Create a GUI to allow the user to play a game of chess against the smart computer, while seeing the board and being able to interact with it</li> 
	<li>Integrate this application with my website to allow users to be able to play against the computer from lucferrara.com/chess</li>
	<li>Far in the future: make lucferrara.com/chess an online experience!</li>
	
</ol>

I will continue to update this README to keep track of what goals I have accomplished, and any future goals that I create as I continue to work on this project.
