# LUChess
My name is Luc Ferrara, and I am a Computer Science student at Northeastern University. On the side, I am a 2000+ rated chess player on both Chess.com and lichess.org (my username is Luc120 on both sites). I love chess, so I have decided to try to create a chess application of my own as a fun side challenge.
